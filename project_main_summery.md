# C Programming Books Concept Extraction System

## Project Overview

The "Summarizing C Holy Grail Book" project is a sophisticated AI-powered system designed to extract atomic programming concepts from classic C programming textbooks. The system transforms traditional programming books into structured, machine-readable training data for AI models learning C programming.

## Core Mission

Transform existing single-book extraction system into a multi-book, multi-AI daily extraction pipeline. Each book uses a different AI model while maintaining the same atomic concept JSON format for consistency.

## Project Architecture

### Core Modules (`core/`)

#### 1. PDF Structure Extractor (`pdf_extractor.py`)
- **Purpose**: Intelligently extracts and classifies content from PDF documents
- **Key Features**:
  - Context-aware content classification (headers, code blocks, explanatory text)
  - Structure detection for programming books
  - Page-based content extraction with configurable limits
- **Technology**: Built on `pdfplumber` library

#### 2. Concept Boundary Detector (`concept_detector.py`)
- **Purpose**: Detects natural atomic concept boundaries in structured content
- **Key Features**:
  - Groups content blocks into coherent atomic concepts
  - Ensures concepts have both explanation and code components
  - Maintains concept completeness and educational value

#### 3. Progress Tracker (`progress_tracker.py`)
- **Purpose**: Manages extraction progress across multiple sessions
- **Key Features**:
  - Tracks last processed page per book
  - Maintains concept extraction counts
  - Session history and metadata

### AI Processors (`processors/`)

#### Current Implementation
- **Gemini Processor** (`gemini_processor.py`): Uses Google's Gemini 1.5 Flash model
  - Processes raw content into structured atomic concepts
  - Maintains consistent JSON output format
  - Currently active for K&R C Programming book

#### Planned Processors
- **Claude Processor**: For Advanced UNIX Programming book
- **Grok Processor**: For Operating Systems - Three Easy Pieces book

### Book-Specific Extractors (`books/`)

#### Active Extractor
- **K&R C Concepts** (`extract_c_concepts.py`): âœ… Fully operational
  - Source: "The C Programming Language" by Kernighan & Ritchie
  - Output: `outputs/kernighan_ritchie/`
  - Status: 12 concepts extracted as of 2025-07-13

#### Planned Extractors
- **UNIX Environment** (`extract_unix_env.py`): Advanced Programming in UNIX Environment
- **Linkers & Loaders** (`extract_linkers_loaders.py`): LinkersAndLoaders concepts
- **Operating Systems** (`extract_os_three_pieces.py`): OS algorithms and data structures

## Book-AI Mapping Strategy

| Book | AI Model | Status | Focus Area |
|------|----------|--------|------------|
| K&R C Programming | Gemini (Google) | âœ… Active | C language syntax, operators, control structures |
| Advanced UNIX Programming | Claude (Anthropic) | ðŸ”„ Planned | System calls, APIs, UNIX programming patterns |
| Linkers & Loaders | Gemini (Second Instance) | ðŸ”„ Planned | Binary formats, linking mechanics, loader concepts |
| Operating Systems | Grok (X.AI) | ðŸ”„ Planned | OS algorithms, data structures, system concepts |

## Atomic Concept Format

Each extracted concept follows a standardized JSON structure:

```json
{
  "topic": "Concept Name",
  "explanation": "Clear definition of what this concept is and why it's used",
  "syntax": "generalized code pattern",
  "code_example": [
    "line1 of complete program",
    "line2 of complete program"
  ],
  "example_explanation": "How this specific example demonstrates the concept",
  "extraction_metadata": {
    "source": "Book Title",
    "page_range": "X-Y",
    "extraction_date": "ISO timestamp",
    "has_code": boolean,
    "has_explanation": boolean
  }
}
```

## Current Progress Status

### K&R C Programming (Active)
- **Concepts Extracted**: 12 atomic concepts
- **Last Processed Page**: 45
- **Extraction Sessions**: 3 completed
- **Recent Concepts**: Null-termination of strings, External variables, Function definitions

### Other Books (Pending)
- **Advanced UNIX Programming**: Ready for Claude processor implementation
- **Linkers & Loaders**: Awaiting Gemini second instance setup
- **Operating Systems**: Requires Grok processor development

## Technical Implementation

### Dependencies
- `pdfplumber==0.10.3`: PDF text extraction
- `google-generativeai==0.3.2`: Gemini AI integration
- `python-dotenv==1.0.0`: Environment configuration
- `requests==2.31.0`: HTTP requests

### Configuration
- **API Keys**: Stored in `config/config.env`
- **Book Settings**: `config/books_config.json` (planned)
- **Rate Limiting**: 2-3 second delays between API calls
- **Daily Limits**: 4 concepts per book per day

### Output Structure
```
outputs/
â”œâ”€â”€ kernighan_ritchie/          # K&R C concepts
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ concept_001_*.json      # Individual atomic concepts
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ daily_summary_*.md      # Daily extraction reports
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ progress.json           # Progress tracking
â”œâ”€â”€ unix_env/                   # UNIX programming (planned)
â”œâ”€â”€ linkers_loaders/            # Linking concepts (planned)
â””â”€â”€ os_three_pieces/            # OS concepts (planned)
```

## Educational Value

### Learning Approach
- **Atomic Concepts**: Each concept is self-contained and teachable
- **Progressive Learning**: Concepts build upon each other naturally
- **Practical Examples**: Every concept includes compilable C code
- **Contextual Understanding**: Explanations connect theory to practice

### Use Cases
- **AI Training Data**: Structured format for machine learning models
- **Educational Resources**: Bite-sized learning modules
- **Reference Material**: Quick concept lookup and review
- **Curriculum Development**: Building blocks for C programming courses

## Quality Assurance

### Content Validation
- Concepts must have both explanation and code components
- Code examples must be complete and compilable
- Topics are clearly defined and focused
- Explanations are pedagogically sound

### Progress Tracking
- Daily summaries track extraction quality
- Session-based progress monitoring
- Metadata preservation for traceability
- Error handling with graceful degradation

## Future Development

### Phase 2 (In Progress)
1. Implement Claude processor for UNIX book
2. Create Grok processor for OS book
3. Develop book-specific extractors
4. Build master daily runner script

### Phase 3 (Planned)
1. Consolidated multi-book daily summaries
2. Cross-book concept relationship mapping
3. Advanced concept categorization
4. Interactive learning interface

## Development Status
