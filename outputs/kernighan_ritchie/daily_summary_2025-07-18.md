**Page Range:** 136-150

## Concepts Extracted Today: 4

### 1. Process Creation and Execution with fork() and exec()
**What it's about:** In UNIX system programming, creating and managing processes is fundamental.  `fork()` duplicates the current process, creating a child process that's an almost exact copy.  `exec()` family of function...

- **Pages:** 136-136

### 2. Pointer Operations and Memory Management with `free()`
**What it's about:** In C, dynamic memory allocation using `malloc()` requires explicit deallocation using `free()` to prevent memory leaks.  Pointers are essential for managing dynamically allocated memory.  `free()` rel...

- **Pages:** 136-136

### 3. Pointer Operations and Dynamic Memory Allocation
**What it's about:** Pointers in C are variables that hold memory addresses.  Dynamic memory allocation allows a program to request memory during runtime, unlike statically allocated memory whose size is fixed at compile ...

- **Pages:** 136-136

### 4. Function Definition and Call
**What it's about:** Functions are self-contained blocks of code that perform a specific task. They promote modularity, reusability, and code organization in C programs.  Functions are defined once and can be called multi...
