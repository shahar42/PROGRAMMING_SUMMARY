## Concepts Extracted Today: 4

### 1. Pointers and Arrays
**What it's about:** Pointers are variables that store memory addresses.  In C, they are fundamental for manipulating data efficiently, particularly when working with arrays and dynamically allocated memory. Arrays are co...

- **Pages:** 91-91

### 2. Dynamic Memory Allocation with malloc
**What it's about:** In C, dynamic memory allocation allows you to request memory during program execution, as opposed to static allocation where memory is assigned at compile time.  This is crucial for handling data stru...

### 3. Pointers and Arrays
**What it's about:** Pointers are variables that store memory addresses.  In C, they are fundamental for dynamic memory allocation, manipulating data structures, and efficiently passing data to functions. Arrays are conti...

### 4. Arrays of Pointers
**What it's about:** In C, an array of pointers allows you to store multiple pointers, each pointing to a different data structure (like a string or another data type). This is particularly useful for managing collections...
