  "topic": "Null-Termination of Strings",
  "explanation": "In C, strings are represented as arrays of characters.  A special character, the null character ('\\0'), is appended to the end of the array to mark its end. This is crucial because functions that work with strings (like `printf` or `strcpy`) rely on this null terminator to know where the string ends. Without it, these functions would read beyond the allocated memory, leading to unpredictable behavior or crashes.",
  "syntax": "char string[] = \"some text\\0\";",
  "code_example": [
    "#include <stdio.h>",
    "",
    "int main() {",
    "  char myString[] = \"Hello, world!\\0\";",
    "  printf(\"%s\\n\", myString);",
    "  return 0;",
    "}"
  ],
  "example_explanation": "This program declares a character array `myString` and initializes it with the string literal \"Hello, world!\".  The compiler automatically adds the null terminator ('\\0') at the end. The `printf` function uses the null terminator to determine where the string ends, correctly printing \"Hello, world!\" to the console.  This demonstrates how the null terminator is implicitly used to define string boundaries in C.",
