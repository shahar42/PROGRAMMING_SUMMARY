  "syntax": "variable = expression;  // Basic assignment\nvariable op= expression; // Compound assignment (op can be +=, -=, *=, /=, %=, <<=, >>=, &=, ^=, |=)",
  "code_example": [
    "#include <stdio.h>",

    "int main() {",
    "  int a = 10;",
    "  int b = 5;",

  ],
  "example_explanation": "This program demonstrates basic and compound assignment.  Initially, `a` is 10 and `b` is 5. `a += b;` adds the value of `b` to `a`, resulting in `a` becoming 15.  `b *= 2;` multiplies `b` by 2, making `b` equal to 10. The `printf` function then displays the final values of `a` and `b`.",
