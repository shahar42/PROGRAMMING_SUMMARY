  "topic": "Pointers and Arrays",
  "explanation": "Pointers are variables that store memory addresses.  In C, they are fundamental for manipulating data efficiently, particularly when working with arrays and dynamically allocated memory. Arrays are contiguous blocks of memory holding elements of the same data type. Pointers and arrays are closely related in C because an array name decays into a pointer to its first element in most contexts. This allows for flexible and efficient data access and manipulation.",
  "syntax": "Datatype *pointer_name; \n\n/* Array declaration */\ndatatype array_name[array_size];\n\n/* Accessing array elements using pointers */\npointer_name = array_name; // pointer_name now points to the first element of array_name\n*(pointer_name + i)  // Accesses the i-th element of the array\npointer_name[i] //Equivalent to *(pointer_name + i)",

  "example_explanation": "This example demonstrates the relationship between pointers and arrays. An integer array `numbers` is declared and initialized. A pointer `ptr` is declared and assigned the address of the first element of the array.  The first loop iterates through the array using standard array notation. The second loop achieves the same result using pointer arithmetic: `*(ptr + i)` accesses the element at the memory location `i` positions away from the address stored in `ptr`.  This highlights how pointer arithmetic can be used to traverse and manipulate array elements, a key technique in C programming.",
