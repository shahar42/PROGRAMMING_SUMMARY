  "explanation": "The `for` loop is a control flow statement that allows you to repeatedly execute a block of code a specific number of times. It's more concise and structured than a `while` loop for situations where you know the number of iterations in advance.  It's used for iterating over sequences, performing repetitive tasks a set number of times, and generally improving code readability when dealing with loops.",
  "syntax": "for (initialization; condition; increment) { \n  // Code to be executed repeatedly \n}",
  "code_example": [
    "#include <stdio.h>",
    "int main() {",
    "  int fahr;",
    "  for (fahr = 0; fahr <= 300; fahr = fahr + 20) {",
    "    printf(\"%3d %6.1f\\n\", fahr, (5.0/9.0)*(fahr-32));",
    "  }",
    "  return 0;",
    "}"
  ],
  "example_explanation": "This example demonstrates a `for` loop that iterates from 0 to 300 (inclusive), incrementing by 20 in each step.  `fahr = 0` initializes the loop counter. `fahr <= 300` is the condition that continues the loop as long as `fahr` is less than or equal to 300. `fahr = fahr + 20` increments `fahr` by 20 after each iteration. Inside the loop, `printf` prints the Fahrenheit and Celsius equivalent calculated from the current value of `fahr`.",
