## Concepts Extracted Today: 4

### 1. Bitwise AND Operator (&)
**What it's about:** The bitwise AND operator compares corresponding bits of two integer operands. If both bits are 1, the resulting bit is 1; otherwise, it's 0.  It's used for masking: selecting specific bits within an i...

- **Pages:** 46-46

### 2. Assignment Operators
**What it's about:** Assignment operators in C are used to assign values to variables.  They take a value on the right-hand side and store it into the variable on the left-hand side.  This is fundamental for manipulating ...

### 3. Compound Assignment Operators
**What it's about:** Compound assignment operators in C combine an arithmetic or bitwise operation with an assignment.  They provide a shorter, more concise way to update a variable's value by performing an operation on i...

### 4. Counting Set Bits in an Integer
**What it's about:** This concept describes how to count the number of bits that are set to 1 in an unsigned integer.  It's useful in various bit manipulation tasks, such as determining the number of active flags or analy...
