## Concepts Extracted Today: 4

### 1. Null-Termination of Strings
**What it's about:** In C, strings are represented as arrays of characters.  A special character, the null character ('\0'), is appended to the end of the array to mark its end. This is crucial because functions that work...

- **Pages:** 31-31

### 2. External Variables in C
**What it's about:** External variables in C are declared outside of any function, making them globally accessible to all functions within the program.  This allows functions to share data without passing arguments, and t...

- **Pages:** 31-32

### 3. External Variables in C
**What it's about:** External variables, declared with the `extern` keyword, allow you to access variables defined in other source files. This is crucial for modularity and code organization in larger C programs.  By decl...

- **Pages:** 32-32

### 4. Function Definition in C
**What it's about:** A function definition in C specifies a block of reusable code that performs a specific task.  It's used to organize and modularize code, making programs easier to understand, maintain, and debug.  Fun...
