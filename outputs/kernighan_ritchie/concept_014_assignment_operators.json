  "topic": "Assignment Operators",
  "explanation": "Assignment operators in C are used to assign values to variables.  They take a value on the right-hand side and store it into the variable on the left-hand side.  This is fundamental for manipulating data within a C program.",
  "syntax": "variable = expression;",
  "code_example": [
    "#include <stdio.h>",
    "int main() {",
    "  int x, y;",
    "  x = 10; // Assigns the value 10 to variable x",
    "  y = x + 5; // Assigns the result of x + 5 (15) to y",
    "  printf(\"x = %d, y = %d\\n\", x, y);",
    "  return 0;",
    "}"
  ],
  "example_explanation": "This example demonstrates the basic assignment operator (=).  It first assigns the integer value 10 to the variable `x`. Then, it calculates `x + 5` (which equals 15) and assigns this result to the variable `y`. Finally, it prints the values of `x` and `y` to the console, showing the effect of the assignments.",
