  "topic": "The main() Function",
  "explanation": "The main() function is the entry point of a C program, where execution begins when the program is run as a process by the operating system. It is used because it allows the program to define its behavior, transforming static code into a running entity that interacts with the system.",
  "syntax": "int main()",
  "code_example": [
    "#include <stdio.h>",
    "int main() {",
    "    printf(\"This is a running C program.\\n\");",
    "    return 0;",
    "}"
  ],
  "example_explanation": "This example demonstrates the main() function as the starting point of a C program. When executed, it prints 'This is a running C program.' to the console and returns 0, showing how the program comes to life as a process and performs a simple action before terminating.",
