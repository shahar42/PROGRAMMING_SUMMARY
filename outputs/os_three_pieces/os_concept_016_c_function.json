  "topic": "C Function",
  "explanation": "A C function is a reusable block of code that performs a specific task. It is used to organize code into logical units, promote reusability, and make programs easier to read, debug, and maintain, much like how policies in an operating system are algorithms for decision-making.",
  "syntax": "return_type function_name(parameter_types);",
  "code_example": [
    "#include <stdio.h>",
    "",
    "int add(int a, int b) {",
    "    return a + b;",
    "}",
    "",
    "int main() {",
    "    int result = add(3, 4);",
    "    printf(\"%d\\n\", result);",
    "    return 0;",
    "}"
  ],
  "example_explanation": "This example defines a simple function 'add' that takes two integers as parameters and returns their sum. The main function calls 'add' with arguments 3 and 4, stores the result, and prints it, demonstrating how a C function encapsulates a specific task and can be invoked to perform that task within a program.",
