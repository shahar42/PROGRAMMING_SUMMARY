  "topic": "String Literal",
  "explanation": "A string literal in C is a sequence of characters enclosed in double quotes, representing a constant string of text. It is used to store and manipulate fixed strings in programs, such as messages or data that do not change during execution, making it essential for output, input handling, and string operations.",
  "syntax": "\"string content here\"",
  "code_example": [
    "#include <stdio.h>",
    "int main() {",
    "    printf(\"Hello, World!\\n\");",
    "    return 0;",
    "}"
  ],
  "example_explanation": "This program includes the stdio.h header for input/output functions and defines the main function. It uses the string literal \"Hello, World!\\n\" as an argument to printf, which prints the string to the console, demonstrating how string literals provide constant text for display without modification.",
