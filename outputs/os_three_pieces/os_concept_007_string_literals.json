  "explanation": "A string literal in C is a sequence of characters enclosed in double quotes, representing a constant string of text. It is used to store and display textual data in programs, such as messages or identifiers, providing a simple way to handle strings without dynamic memory allocation.",
  "syntax": "\"text here\"",
  "code_example": [
    "#include <stdio.h>",
    "",
    "int main() {",
    "    printf(\"You can also purchase a printed copy from lulu.com.\\n\");",
    "    return 0;",
    "}"
  ],
  "example_explanation": "This program includes the standard input-output library and defines the main function. It uses the printf function to output the string literal \"You can also purchase a printed copy from lulu.com.\" to the console, demonstrating how a string literal is declared and used to display text, directly based on the provided content.",
