  "topic": "Basic Output in C",
  "explanation": "Basic output in C refers to the process of displaying information to the user through the console. It is used to communicate results, messages, or data from the program, making it essential for interactive and informative programs. Without output, a program's execution would be invisible, limiting its utility in real-world applications.",
  "syntax": "printf(\"format string\", argument1, argument2, ...);",
  "code_example": [
    "#include <stdio.h>",
    "int main() {",
    "    printf(\"Hello, World!\\n\");",
    "    return 0;",
    "}"
  ],
  "example_explanation": "This example demonstrates basic output in C by using the printf function to display the string 'Hello, World!' on the console. When the program runs, it outputs this message followed by a newline, showing how printf sends text to the standard output, which aligns with the concept of programs performing I/O to make their results visible.",
