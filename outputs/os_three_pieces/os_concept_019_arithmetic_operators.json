  "topic": "Arithmetic Operators",
  "explanation": "Arithmetic operators are symbols in C that perform basic mathematical operations on numerical operands, such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, and modulus. They are used to manipulate and calculate values in programs, forming the foundation for numerical computations and data processing.",
  "syntax": "operand1 operator operand2",
  "code_example": [
    "#include <stdio.h>",
    "int main() {",
    "    int a = 5;",
    "    int b = 3;",
    "    int sum = a + b;",
    "    printf(\"%d\\n\", sum);",
    "    return 0;",
    "}"
  ],
  "example_explanation": "This program declares two integers, a and b, uses the + arithmetic operator to add them, stores the result in sum, and prints the value of sum. This demonstrates how the addition operator performs a simple calculation on operands and outputs the result.",
