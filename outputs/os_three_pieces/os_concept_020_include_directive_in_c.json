  "topic": "Include Directive in C",
  "explanation": "The #include directive in C is a preprocessor command that inserts the contents of a specified header file into the source code before compilation. It is used to access external declarations, such as functions, macros, and types from libraries, making it essential for reusing code and interfacing with system or standard libraries.",
  "syntax": "#include <header> or #include \"header\"",
  "code_example": [
    "#include <stdio.h>",
    "int main() {",
    "    printf(\"This demonstrates the include directive.\\n\");",
    "    return 0;",
    "}"
  ],
  "example_explanation": "This example includes the stdio.h header, which provides the declaration for the printf function. The program uses printf to output a message, illustrating how the #include directive incorporates necessary definitions from an external file, enabling the use of standard library functions in the code.",
