  "topic": "Addition Operator",
  "explanation": "The addition operator (+) in C is used to add two numeric operands, resulting in their sum. It is essential for performing basic arithmetic operations in programs, enabling tasks like calculating totals or combining values, which forms the foundation of more complex computations.",
  "syntax": "operand1 + operand2",
  "code_example": [
    "#include <stdio.h>",
    "int main() {",
    "    int a = 5;",
    "    int b = 3;",
    "    int sum = a + b;",
    "    printf(\"%d\\n\", sum);",
    "    return 0;",
    "}"
  ],
  "example_explanation": "This program declares two integers, a and b, uses the + operator to add them and store the result in sum, then prints the sum to the console, demonstrating how the addition operator combines two values in a simple C program.",
