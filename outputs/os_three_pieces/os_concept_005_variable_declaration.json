  "explanation": "A variable in C is a named memory location used to store data values that can be manipulated during program execution. It is essential for holding and referencing data, enabling dynamic computations and program logic.",
  "syntax": "int variable_name;",
  "code_example": [
    "#include <stdio.h>",
    "int main() {",
    "    int v = 10;  // Declare and initialize an integer variable",
    "    printf(\"%d\\n\", v);  // Output the variable's value",
    "    return 0;",
    "}"
  ],
  "example_explanation": "This program declares an integer variable 'v' and initializes it to 10, then prints its value using printf. This demonstrates how variables are declared to allocate memory and used to store and access values in a C program.",
