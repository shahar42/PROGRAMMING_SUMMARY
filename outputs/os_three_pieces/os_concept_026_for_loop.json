  "topic": "For Loop",
  "explanation": "A for loop in C is a control structure that allows a block of code to be executed repeatedly for a specified number of iterations. It is used to perform repetitive tasks efficiently, such as iterating through a sequence or processing items in a loop, making code more concise and easier to manage.",
  "syntax": "for(initialization; condition; increment)",
  "code_example": [
    "#include <stdio.h>",
    "int main() {",
    "    for(int i = 0; i < 5; i++) {",
    "        printf(\"A \");",
    "    }",
    "    for(int i = 0; i < 5; i++) {",
    "        printf(\"B \");",
    "    }",
    "    printf(\"\\n\");",
    "    return 0;",
    "}"
  ],
  "example_explanation": "This example demonstrates a for loop by using two separate loops: the first loop initializes i to 0, checks if i is less than 5, and increments i each time, printing 'A ' five times; the second loop does the same to print 'B ' five times. This shows how the for loop controls repetition based on the condition and increment, resulting in the output 'A A A A A B B B B B ' followed by a newline.",
