## Linking Concepts Extracted Today: 4

### 1. Relocation Entries and Address Patching
**What it's about:** Relocation entries are crucial during the linking and loading process.  They identify parts of an object file whose addresses need to be adjusted (patched) at load time to correctly reflect their fina...

- **Pages:** 46-48

### 2. Relocation Entries and Address Patching
**What it's about:** Relocation entries are crucial components within object files.  During the linking process, the linker doesn't know the absolute memory addresses where code and data segments will reside.  Relocation ...

- **Pages:** 48-49

### 3. Position Independent Code (PIC) and Global Offset Table (GOT)
**What it's about:** Position Independent Code (PIC) is a crucial technique for creating shared libraries and dynamically linked executables.  Because the load address of a shared library isn't known at compile time, PIC ...

### 4. Position Independent Code (PIC)
**What it's about:** Position Independent Code (PIC) is a code generation technique that produces executables or shared libraries whose addresses do not depend on their load address in memory. This is crucial for shared l...
