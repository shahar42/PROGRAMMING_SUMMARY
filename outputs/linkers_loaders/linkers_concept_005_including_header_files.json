  "topic": "Including Header Files",
  "explanation": "Header files in C provide declarations for functions and variables that are defined elsewhere.  They're essential because they allow you to use pre-written code without needing to know its implementation details.  This avoids code duplication and promotes modularity.",
  "syntax": "#include <header_file_name>",
  "code_example": [
    "#include <stdio.h>",
    "",
    "int main() {",
    "    printf(\"Hello, world!\\n\");",
    "    return 0;",
    "}"
  ],
  "example_explanation": "This example uses the `stdio.h` header file.  `stdio.h` declares the `printf` function, which is used to print text to the console.  The `#include` directive instructs the preprocessor to include the contents of `stdio.h` into the source code before compilation, making `printf` available for use in the `main` function. Without `#include <stdio.h>`, the compiler would generate an error because it wouldn't know what `printf` is.",
