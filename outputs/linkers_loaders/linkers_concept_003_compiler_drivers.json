  "topic": "Compiler Drivers",
  "explanation": "A compiler driver is a program that orchestrates the compilation process.  It manages the different stages of compilation, such as preprocessing, compiling, assembling, and linking, often invoking multiple tools in sequence to transform source code into an executable program.  It simplifies the compilation process for the programmer, hiding the complexity of interacting with individual tools.",
  "syntax": "The syntax isn't a single code pattern but rather the invocation of the compiler driver (like gcc) with various options.  For example: `gcc [options] source_file.c -o output_file`",
  "code_example": [
    "#include <stdio.h>",
    "",
    "int main() {",
    "  printf(\"Hello, world!\\n\");",
    "  return 0;",
    "}"
  ],
  "example_explanation": "This example doesn't directly demonstrate the compiler driver itself, but it's a minimal C program that would be compiled using a compiler driver (like `gcc`).  The programmer would write the source code (main.c in this case) and then use a command like `gcc main.c -o hello` to invoke the compiler driver (gcc) which would then handle preprocessing, compilation, assembly, and linking to create the executable file 'hello'.",
