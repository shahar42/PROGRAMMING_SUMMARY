  "topic": "Function Pointer Arrays for Callback Dispatch",
  "explanation": "In advanced C programming, arrays of function pointers are used to implement flexible callback dispatch tables, enabling dynamic selection of functions at runtime. This technique is essential for designing modular, extensible systems such as event handlers, command interpreters, or plugin architectures, where the set of functions to invoke can vary and be managed efficiently without resorting to cumbersome switch statements or repetitive code.",
  "syntax": "return_type (*array_name[])(parameter_types);",
  "code_example": [
    "typedef void (*Callback)(int);",
    "void handlerA(int code) { /* handle code A */ }",
    "void handlerB(int code) { /* handle code B */ }",
    "Callback callbacks[] = { handlerA, handlerB };",
    "int main() {",
    "    int event = 1; // Suppose event determines which handler to call",
    "    callbacks[event](42); // Invoke the selected callback with argument",
    "    return 0;",
    "}"
  ],
  "example_explanation": "This example defines an array of function pointers 'callbacks' that point to different handler functions. By indexing into this array with an event variable, the program dynamically dispatches the appropriate callback at runtime. This demonstrates advanced use of function pointer arrays for flexible, efficient callback mechanisms in C, a technique often employed in complex systems requiring dynamic behavior and modular design.",
