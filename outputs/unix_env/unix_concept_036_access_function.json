  "topic": "access function",
  "explanation": "The access function in C is used to check the accessibility of a file based on the real user and group IDs, rather than the effective ones. This is important for processes running with elevated privileges, such as those using set-user-ID or set-group-ID, to verify if the actual user has permission to access the file, ensuring security and proper authorization checks.",
  "syntax": "int access(const char *pathname, int mode);",
  "code_example": [
    "#include <unistd.h>",
    "#include <stdio.h>",
    "",
    "int main() {",
    "    if (access(\"example.txt\", R_OK) == 0) {",
    "        printf(\"The file is readable.\\n\");",
    "    } else {",
    "        printf(\"The file is not readable.\\n\");",
    "    }",
    "    return 0;",
    "}"
  ],
  "example_explanation": "This program uses the access function to check if 'example.txt' is readable (R_OK mode) by the real user. If access returns 0, it means the file is accessible, and the program prints a success message; otherwise, it prints a failure message. This demonstrates how access performs the check based on real user IDs, isolating the concept in a simple, runnable context.",
