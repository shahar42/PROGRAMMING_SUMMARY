  "topic": "Main Function in C",
  "explanation": "The main function is the entry point of any C program, where execution begins. It is essential because it serves as the starting point for the program to run, allowing the operating system to call it when the program is executed. In UNIX-standardized C environments, adhering to the standard signature ensures portability and compatibility across systems.",
  "syntax": "int main(void)",
  "code_example": [
    "#include <stdio.h>",
    "int main(void) {",
    "    printf(\"Hello, UNIX Standard C!\\n\");",
    "    return 0;",
    "}"
  ],
  "example_explanation": "This example defines the main function with the standard signature, which is called when the program runs. It includes the stdio.h header for input/output functions, uses printf to output a message demonstrating basic functionality, and returns 0 to indicate successful execution, showing how the main function serves as the program's entry and exit point in a UNIX-standardized context.",
