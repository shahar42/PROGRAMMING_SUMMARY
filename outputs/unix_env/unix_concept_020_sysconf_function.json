  "topic": "sysconf Function",
  "explanation": "The sysconf function in C is used to retrieve the current value of a configurable system limit or option at runtime. It is necessary because some system limits can vary depending on the environment or configuration, allowing programs to query these values dynamically rather than relying on hardcoded constants, which ensures portability and accuracy across different systems.",
  "syntax": "long sysconf(int name);",
  "code_example": [
    "#include <unistd.h>",
    "#include <stdio.h>",
    "int main() {",
    "    long value = sysconf(_SC_OPEN_MAX);",
    "    if (value != -1) {",
    "        printf(\"The maximum number of open files is: %ld\\n\", value);",
    "    } else {",
    "        printf(\"Error retrieving value\\n\");",
    "    }",
    "    return 0;",
    "}"
  ],
  "example_explanation": "This example demonstrates the sysconf function by calling it with _SC_OPEN_MAX to retrieve the system's maximum number of open files. It checks if the value is successfully obtained (not -1, indicating an error) and prints the result, showing how sysconf queries a runtime system limit and handles potential failures.",
