  "topic": "clock() Function",
  "explanation": "The clock() function in C is used to measure the processor time consumed by the program since it started. It returns the number of clock ticks, which can be converted to seconds for timing purposes, making it useful for benchmarking code performance and understanding execution duration.",
  "syntax": "clock_t clock(void);",
  "code_example": [
    "#include <stdio.h>",
    "#include <time.h>",
    "",
    "int main() {",
    "    clock_t start = clock();",
    "    // Simulate some work with a simple loop",
    "    for(volatile int i = 0; i < 1000000000; i++);",
    "    clock_t end = clock();",
    "    double time_spent = (double)(end - start) / CLOCKS_PER_SEC;",
    "    printf(\"Time spent: %f seconds\\n\", time_spent);",
    "    return 0;",
    "}"
  ],
  "example_explanation": "This program demonstrates the clock() function by recording the start time before a loop, performing a simple computation to simulate work, then recording the end time. It calculates and prints the time spent in seconds, showing how clock() measures CPU time for a specific code section.",
