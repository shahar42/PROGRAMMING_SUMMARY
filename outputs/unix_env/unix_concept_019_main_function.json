  "topic": "Main Function",
  "explanation": "The main function is the entry point of a C program, where execution begins when the program is run. It is essential because it serves as the starting point for the program's logic, allowing the code to perform tasks and return a status code to the operating system, indicating success or failure.",
  "syntax": "int main(void)",
  "code_example": [
    "int main() {",
    "    return 0;",
    "}"
  ],
  "example_explanation": "This example defines the main function as the program's entry point. When compiled and run, it executes the function, which immediately returns 0 to indicate successful completion, demonstrating how the main function is the minimal requirement for a C program to start and end execution.",
