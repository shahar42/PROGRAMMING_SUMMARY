  "topic": "Conditional Compilation with #if defined",
  "explanation": "Conditional compilation in C allows specific parts of the code to be included or excluded during preprocessing based on whether certain macros are defined. It is used to create platform-specific code, ensuring that programs can adapt to different operating systems like FreeBSD, Linux, or Mac OS X, which helps in maintaining portability and avoiding compilation errors on unsupported platforms.",
  "syntax": "#if defined(macro) statement #endif",
  "code_example": [
    "#include <stdio.h>",
    "",
    "int main() {",
    "    #if defined(__linux__)",
    "        printf(\"This is for Linux\\n\");",
    "    #else",
    "        printf(\"This is not Linux\\n\");",
    "    #endif",
    "    return 0;",
    "}"
  ],
  "example_explanation": "This example compiles a simple program that prints 'This is for Linux' only if the __linux__ macro is defined (typically on Linux systems), and 'This is not Linux' otherwise. It demonstrates conditional compilation by selectively executing code based on the platform, limiting the output to match the environment without affecting the program's overall structure.",
