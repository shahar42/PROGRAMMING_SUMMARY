  "topic": "C Programming Language",
  "explanation": "The C programming language is a general-purpose, procedural programming language developed in the early 1970s. It is used for system programming, embedded systems, and application development because it provides low-level access to memory, high efficiency, and portability across different platforms, making it a foundational language for modern computing.",
  "syntax": "A basic C program structure includes:\n#include <header.h>  /* Include necessary headers */\nint main() {  /* Main function */\n    /* Code statements */\n    return 0;  /* Return statement */\n}",
  "code_example": [
    "#include <stdio.h>",
    "",
    "int main() {",
    "    printf(\"Hello, World!\\n\");",
    "    return 0;",
    "}"
  ],
  "example_explanation": "This example demonstrates the C programming language by showing a simple program that outputs 'Hello, World!' to the console. The #include directive imports the standard input-output header, the main() function serves as the entry point, printf() prints the message, and return 0; indicates successful execution, illustrating the basic structure and execution flow of C code.",
