  "topic": "Function Definition",
  "explanation": "A function definition in C is the complete implementation of a reusable block of code that performs a specific task. It includes the return type, function name, parameters, and the body of code to execute. It is used to modularize programs, promote code reuse, and improve readability and maintainability by breaking down complex tasks into smaller, manageable parts.",
  "syntax": "return_type function_name(parameter_types) { /* function body */ }",
  "code_example": [
    "#include <stdio.h>",
    "",
    "int add(int a, int b) {",
    "    return a + b;",
    "}",
    "",
    "int main() {",
    "    int result = add(2, 3);",
    "    printf(\"%d\\n\", result);",
    "    return 0;",
    "}"
  ],
  "example_explanation": "This example defines a function 'add' that takes two integers as parameters and returns their sum. The main function calls 'add' with arguments 2 and 3, stores the result, and prints it, demonstrating how a function is defined, invoked, and used to perform a simple calculation in C.",
