  "topic": "Void Pointer in C",
  "explanation": "A void pointer (void*) in C is a generic pointer type that can hold the address of any data type without specifying it. It is used to create flexible functions that can work with different kinds of data, such as buffers in file I/O operations, allowing for reusability and consistency with standards like ISO C.",
  "syntax": "ssize_t read(int fd, void *buf, size_t count)",
  "code_example": [
    "#include <unistd.h>",
    "#include <stdio.h>",
    "int main() {",
    "    char buffer[10];",
    "    ssize_t bytes_read = read(0, buffer, sizeof(buffer));",
    "    if (bytes_read > 0) {",
    "        printf(\"Read %zd bytes\\n\", bytes_read);",
    "    }",
    "    return 0;",
    "}"
  ],
  "example_explanation": "This program demonstrates the void pointer by using the read function to read from standard input into a char array. The void* parameter in read allows the buffer to be any type, here a char array, showing how it enables generic handling of data without specifying the type in the function signature.",
