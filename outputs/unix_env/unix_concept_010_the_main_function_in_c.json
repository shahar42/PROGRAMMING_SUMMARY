  "topic": "The main Function in C",
  "explanation": "The main function is the entry point of a C program, where execution begins when the program is run. It is essential because the operating system calls this function to start the program, allowing it to perform tasks and return a status code to indicate success or failure.",
  "syntax": "int main(void)",
  "code_example": [
    "#include <stdio.h>",
    "int main() {",
    "    printf(\"This is the main function in action.\\n\");",
    "    return 0;",
    "}"
  ],
  "example_explanation": "This example defines the main function as the program's starting point. When executed, it prints a message to demonstrate that the code inside main runs, and then returns 0 to signal successful completion, illustrating how main serves as the entry for program execution.",
