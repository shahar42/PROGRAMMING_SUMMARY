  "topic": "Hello, World! Program",
  "explanation": "The Hello, World! program is a fundamental introductory concept in C programming. It demonstrates the basic structure of a C program, including how to include libraries, define the main function, and produce output to the console. It is used to help beginners understand program execution and verify that their development environment is working correctly.",
  "syntax": "int main() {\n    // Code to perform actions, such as printing output\n    return 0;\n}",
  "code_example": [
    "#include <stdio.h>",
    "",
    "int main() {",
    "    printf(\"Hello, World!\\n\");",
    "    return 0;",
    "}"
  ],
  "example_explanation": "This example starts by including the standard input/output header <stdio.h> to access the printf function. The main function is defined as the entry point, where printf is used to output the string 'Hello, World!' followed by a newline to the console. The program then returns 0 to indicate successful execution, demonstrating how a simple C program runs from start to finish.",
