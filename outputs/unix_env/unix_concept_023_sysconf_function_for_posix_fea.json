  "topic": "sysconf Function for POSIX Feature Testing",
  "explanation": "The sysconf function is a POSIX standard function that allows a program to query the system for the current value of a configurable system variable. It is used to check at runtime whether specific POSIX features, such as threads or timers, are supported by the implementation, enabling portable code across different systems and avoiding compilation errors on unsupported platforms.",
  "syntax": "long sysconf(int name);",
  "code_example": [
    "#include <unistd.h>",
    "#include <stdio.h>",
    "int main() {",
    "    long threads_support = sysconf(_SC_THREADS);",
    "    if (threads_support != -1) {",
    "        printf(\"Threads are supported\\n\");",
    "    } else {",
    "        printf(\"Threads are not supported\\n\");",
    "    }",
    "    return 0;",
    "}"
  ],
  "example_explanation": "This example demonstrates the sysconf function by checking if the _SC_THREADS option is supported. It calls sysconf with _SC_THREADS as the argument; if the return value is not -1, it prints that threads are supported, showing how the function queries POSIX feature availability at runtime.",
