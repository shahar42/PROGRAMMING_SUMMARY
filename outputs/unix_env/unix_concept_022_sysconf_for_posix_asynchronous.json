  "topic": "sysconf for POSIX Asynchronous I/O Support",
  "explanation": "sysconf is a C standard library function that queries the system for the value of a configuration option, such as whether a specific POSIX feature is supported. It is used to ensure program portability by checking at runtime if features like asynchronous I/O are available, preventing errors on systems that do not support them.",
  "syntax": "long sysconf(int name);",
  "code_example": [
    "#include <stdio.h>",
    "#include <unistd.h>",
    "",
    "int main() {",
    "    long value = sysconf(_SC_ASYNCHRONOUS_IO);",
    "    if (value != -1 && value > 0) {",
    "        printf(\"Asynchronous I/O is supported.\\n\");",
    "    } else {",
    "        printf(\"Asynchronous I/O is not supported.\\n\");",
    "    }",
    "    return 0;",
    "}"
  ],
  "example_explanation": "This program calls sysconf with _SC_ASYNCHRONOUS_IO to check if asynchronous I/O is supported. If the returned value is not -1 and greater than 0, it prints that the feature is supported; otherwise, it indicates it's not supported, demonstrating how sysconf queries POSIX feature availability at runtime.",
