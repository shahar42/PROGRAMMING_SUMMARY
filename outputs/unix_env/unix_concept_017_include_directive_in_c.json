  "topic": "#include Directive in C",
  "explanation": "The #include directive is a preprocessor command in C that inserts the contents of a specified header file into the current source file before compilation. It is used to access declarations, such as functions and macros, from standard or custom libraries, promoting code modularity and reuse.",
  "syntax": "#include <header.h> or #include \"header.h\"",
  "code_example": [
    "#include <stdio.h>",
    "",
    "int main() {",
    "    printf(\"Hello, World!\\n\");",
    "    return 0;",
    "}"
  ],
  "example_explanation": "This example demonstrates the #include directive by including the stdio.h header file, which provides the declaration for the printf function. The program then uses printf to print 'Hello, World!' to the console, illustrating how the directive makes external functions available for use.",
