  "topic": "sysconf Function",
  "explanation": "The sysconf function is a POSIX standard function that retrieves the value of a system configuration variable at runtime. It is used because some system limits and parameters are not fixed at compile time and may vary based on the system's configuration or resources, allowing programs to query and adapt to these values dynamically for better portability and reliability.",
  "syntax": "long sysconf(int name);",
  "code_example": [
    "#include <stdio.h>",
    "#include <unistd.h>",
    "int main() {",
    "    long value = sysconf(_SC_CLK_TCK);",
    "    if (value != -1) {",
    "        printf(\"The value of _SC_CLK_TCK is: %ld\\n\", value);",
    "    } else {",
    "        printf(\"Value could not be determined\\n\");",
    "    }",
    "    return 0;",
    "}"
  ],
  "example_explanation": "This program includes the required headers, calls sysconf with the _SC_CLK_TCK parameter to retrieve the number of clock ticks per second at runtime, and prints the result. If the value is successfully obtained, it demonstrates how sysconf queries a system configuration variable; otherwise, it handles the error, showing the function's behavior in a real-world context.",
