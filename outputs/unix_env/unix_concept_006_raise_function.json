  "topic": "raise Function",
  "explanation": "The raise function in C is used to send a signal to the calling process. It is primarily employed for testing signal handlers within a program or simulating signal behavior without external intervention, allowing developers to handle and debug signal-related code more effectively.",
  "syntax": "int raise(int sig); // sig is the signal number to be sent to the calling process",
  "code_example": [
    "#include <stdio.h>",
    "#include <signal.h>",
    "",
    "void handler(int sig) {",
    "    printf(\"Signal handled: %d\\n\", sig);",
    "}",
    "",
    "int main() {",
    "    // Register the handler for SIGINT signal",
    "    signal(SIGINT, handler);",
    "    // Send the SIGINT signal to the current process",
    "    raise(SIGINT);",
    "    return 0;",
    "}"
  ],
  "example_explanation": "This program first registers a custom handler function for the SIGINT signal using signal(). It then calls raise(SIGINT) to send the SIGINT signal to the current process, which triggers the handler. The handler prints the signal number, demonstrating how raise delivers the signal and invokes the associated handler.",
