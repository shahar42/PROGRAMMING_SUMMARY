  "topic": "sysconf Function",
  "explanation": "The sysconf function in C retrieves the value of a system configuration variable at runtime, based on a specified name. It is used to access system limits and options that may vary across different operating systems or configurations, allowing programs to adapt dynamically and avoid hardcoding values that could lead to errors or incompatibilities.",
  "syntax": "long sysconf(int name);",
  "code_example": [
    "#include <stdio.h>",
    "#include <unistd.h>",
    "int main() {",
    "    long result = sysconf(_SC_CLK_TCK);",
    "    if (result != -1) {",
    "        printf(\"Clock ticks per second: %ld\\n\", result);",
    "    } else {",
    "        printf(\"Error occurred\\n\");",
    "    }",
    "    return 0;",
    "}"
  ],
  "example_explanation": "This program demonstrates the sysconf function by retrieving the value of _SC_CLK_TCK, which represents the number of clock ticks per second on the system. It checks if the function returns -1 (indicating an error) and prints the result if successful, showing how sysconf queries and returns a system-specific configuration value.",
