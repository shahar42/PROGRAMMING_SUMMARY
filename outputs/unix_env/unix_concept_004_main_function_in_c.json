  "explanation": "The main function is the entry point of any C program. It is where the program begins execution when run. Every C program requires a main function to start, as it serves as the starting point for the compiler and operating system to execute code, allowing the program to perform tasks and return a status.",
  "syntax": "int main() {\n    // Code statements go here\n    return 0;\n}",
  "code_example": [
    "#include <stdio.h>",
    "int main() {",
    "    printf(\"Hello, World!\\n\");",
    "    return 0;",
    "}"
  ],
  "example_explanation": "This example defines the main function, which is the starting point of the program. When executed, it uses printf to output 'Hello, World!' to the console, demonstrating how the main function initiates program flow and ends with a return statement to indicate successful execution.",
