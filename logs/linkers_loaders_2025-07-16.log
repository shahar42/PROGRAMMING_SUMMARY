  "topic": "Relocation Entries and Address Patching",
  "explanation": "Relocation is a crucial step in the linking and loading process.  When code is compiled, addresses of functions, variables, and data segments are often initially relative to the position within the object file.  Because the final memory address of a program is not known until load time,  relocation entries within the object file specify which addresses need to be adjusted (patched) to reflect the program's actual l...
