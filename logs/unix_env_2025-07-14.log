  "topic": "sysconf for POSIX Asynchronous I/O Support",
  "explanation": "sysconf is a C standard library function that queries the system for the value of a configuration option, such as whether a specific POSIX feature is supported. It is used to ensure program portability by checking at runtime if features like asynchronous I/O are available, preventing errors on systems that do not support them.",
  "syntax": "long sysconf(int name);",
  "code_example": [
    "#include <stdio.h>",
    "#include <unistd.h>",
    "",
    "int main() {",
    "    long value = sysconf(_SC_ASYNCHRONOUS_IO);",
    "    if (value != -1 && value > 0) {",
    "        printf(\"Asynchronous I/O is supported.\\n\");",
    "    } else {",
    "        printf(\"Asynchronous I/O is not supported.\\n\");",
    "    }",
    "    return 0;",
    "}"
  ],
  "example_explanation": "This program calls sysconf with _SC_ASYNCHRONOUS_IO to check if asynchronous I/O is supported. If the returned value is not -1 and greater than 0, it prints that the feature is supported; otherwise, it indicates it's not supported, demonstrating how sysconf queries POSIX feature availability at runtime."

Full Grok response: {
  "topic": "sysconf Function for POSIX Feature Testing",
  "explanation": "The sysconf function is a POSIX standard function that allows a program to query the system for the current value of a configurable system variable. It is used to check at runtime whether specific POSIX features, such as threads or timers, are supported by the implementation, enabling portable code across different systems and avoiding compilation errors on unsupported platforms.",
  "syntax": "long sysconf(int name);",
  "code_example": [
    "#include <unistd.h>",
    "#include <stdio.h>",
    "int main() {",
    "    long threads_support = sysconf(_SC_THREADS);",
    "    if (threads_support != -1) {",
    "        printf(\"Threads are supported\\n\");",
    "    } else {",
    "        printf(\"Threads are not supported\\n\");",
    "    }",
    "    return 0;",
    "}"
  ],
  "example_explanation": "This example demonstrates the sysconf function by checking if the _SC_THREADS option is supported. It calls sysconf with _SC_THREADS as the argument; if the return value is not -1, it prints that threads are supported, showing how the function queries POSIX feature availability at runtime."

Full Grok response: {
  "topic": "Conditional Compilation with #if defined",
  "explanation": "Conditional compilation in C allows specific parts of the code to be included or excluded during preprocessing based on whether certain macros are defined. It is used to create platform-specific code, ensuring that programs can adapt to different operating systems like FreeBSD, Linux, or Mac OS X, which helps in maintaining portability and avoiding compilation errors on unsupported platforms.",
  "syntax": "#if defined(macro) statement #endif",
  "code_example": [
    "#include <stdio.h>",
    "",
    "int main() {",
    "    #if defined(__linux__)",
    "        printf(\"This is for Linux\\n\");",
    "    #else",
    "        printf(\"This is not Linux\\n\");",
    "    #endif",
    "    return 0;",
    "}"
  ],
  "example_explanation": "This example compiles a simple program that prints 'This is for Linux' only if the __linux__ macro is defined (typically on Linux systems), and 'This is not Linux' otherwise. It demonstrates conditional compilation by selectively executing code based on the platform, limiting the output to match the environment without affecting the program's overall structure."

Full Grok response: {
  "topic": "Function Definition",
  "explanation": "A function definition in C is the complete implementation of a reusable block of code that performs a specific task. It includes the return type, function name, parameters, and the body of code to execute. It is used to modularize programs, promote code reuse, and improve readability and maintainability by breaking down complex tasks into smaller, manageable parts.",
  "syntax": "return_type function_name(parameter_types) { /* function body */ }",
  "code_example": [
    "#include <stdio.h>",
    "",
    "int add(int a, int b) {",
    "    return a + b;",
    "}",
    "",
    "int main() {",
    "    int result = add(2, 3);",
    "    printf(\"%d\\n\", result);",
    "    return 0;",
    "}"
  ],
  "example_explanation": "This example defines a function 'add' that takes two integers as parameters and returns their sum. The main function calls 'add' with arguments 2 and 3, stores the result, and prints it, demonstrating how a function is defined, invoked, and used to perform a simple calculation in C."
