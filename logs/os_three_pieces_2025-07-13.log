Full Grok response: {
  "topic": "Variable Declaration",
  "explanation": "A variable in C is a named memory location used to store data values that can be manipulated during program execution. It is essential for holding and referencing data, enabling dynamic computations and program logic.",
  "syntax": "int variable_name;",
  "code_example": [
    "#include <stdio.h>",
    "int main() {",
    "    int v = 10;  // Declare and initialize an integer variable",
    "    printf(\"%d\\n\", v);  // Output the variable's value",
    "    return 0;",
    "}"
  ],
  "example_explanation": "This program declares an integer variable 'v' and initializes it to 10, then prints its value using printf. This demonstrates how variables are declared to allocate memory and used to store and access values in a C program."

Full Grok response: {
  "topic": "String Literal",
  "explanation": "A string literal in C is a sequence of characters enclosed in double quotes, representing a constant string of text. It is used to store and manipulate textual data, such as messages or URLs, in programs, making it easier to output information to the user.",
  "syntax": "\"text here\"",
  "code_example": [
    "#include <stdio.h>",
    "",
    "int main() {",
    "    printf(\"http://www.ostep.org\\n\");",
    "    return 0;",
    "}"
  ],
  "example_explanation": "This program includes the stdio.h header for input/output functions. In the main function, it uses printf to output the string literal \"http://www.ostep.org\" followed by a newline, demonstrating how a string literal is defined and used to display text directly in a C program."

Full Grok response: {
  "topic": "String Literals",
  "explanation": "A string literal in C is a sequence of characters enclosed in double quotes, representing a constant string of text. It is used to store and display textual data in programs, such as messages or identifiers, providing a simple way to handle strings without dynamic memory allocation.",
  "syntax": "\"text here\"",
  "code_example": [
    "#include <stdio.h>",
    "",
    "int main() {",
    "    printf(\"You can also purchase a printed copy from lulu.com.\\n\");",
    "    return 0;",
    "}"
  ],
  "example_explanation": "This program includes the standard input-output library and defines the main function. It uses the printf function to output the string literal \"You can also purchase a printed copy from lulu.com.\" to the console, demonstrating how a string literal is declared and used to display text, directly based on the provided content."

Full Grok response: {
  "topic": "Threads in C",
  "explanation": "Threads in C are lightweight units of execution within a process that allow multiple tasks to run concurrently, improving program efficiency and responsiveness. They are used to handle parallel operations, such as I/O-bound or CPU-intensive tasks, but require a solid understanding of processes and memory management to avoid issues like race conditions or deadlocks.",
  "syntax": "int pthread_create(pthread_t *thread, const pthread_attr_t *attr, void *(*start_routine)(void*), void *arg)",
  "code_example": [
    "#include <stdio.h>",
    "#include <pthread.h>",
    "",
    "void *print_message(void *arg) {",
    "    printf(\"Hello from thread!\\n\");",
    "    return NULL;",
    "}",
    "",
    "int main() {",
    "    pthread_t thread_id;",
    "    if (pthread_create(&thread_id, NULL, print_message, NULL) != 0) {",
    "        printf(\"Thread creation failed\\n\");",
    "        return 1;",
    "    }",
    "    pthread_join(thread_id, NULL);",
    "    printf(\"Hello from main thread!\\n\");",
    "    return 0;",
    "}"
  ],
  "example_explanation": "This example demonstrates creating and using a thread in C by defining a function 'print_message' that runs in a new thread. The main function creates the thread with pthread_create, waits for it to finish using pthread_join, and then prints a message. This shows how threads enable concurrent execution, as the new thread prints its message before the main thread continues, illustrating the concept of parallelism in a simple, self-contained program."
